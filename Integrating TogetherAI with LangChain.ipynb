    "📌 So with `__call__` the `TogetherLLM` class instances becomes callable objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 That means, instead of having to explicitly call a method like `instance.call(prompt)`, you can simply use `instance(prompt)`. This makes the code more concise and can improve readability, especially for users who are familiar with functional programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Another advantage is that it allows the `TogetherLLM` class to integrate more seamlessly with Python features and libraries that expect callable objects. For instance, if you're using a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument, you could directly pass an instance of `TogetherLLM` instead of having to wrap it in another function or lambda."
