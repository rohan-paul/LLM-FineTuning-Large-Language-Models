    "🦙 Chat Templates in HuggingFace is just great. 🔥🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Why templates? ❓\n",
    "\n",
    "An increasingly common use case for LLMs is chat. In a chat context, rather than continuing a single string of text (as is the case with a standard language model), the model instead continues a conversation that consists of one or more messages, each of which includes a role as well as message text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat models have been trained with very different formats for converting conversations into a single tokenizable string. Using a format different from the format a model was trained with will usually cause severe, silent performance degradation, so matching the format used during training is extremely important! \n",
    "\n",
    "So, `apply_chat_template` attribute that can be used to save the chat format the model was trained with. This attribute contains a Jinja template that converts conversation histories into a correctly formatted string. \n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "All language models, including models fine-tuned for chat, operate on linear sequences of tokens and do not intrinsically have special handling for roles. This means that role information is usually injected by adding control tokens between messages, to indicate both the message boundary and the relevant roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there isn’t (yet!) a standard for which tokens to use, and so different models have been trained with wildly different formatting and control tokens for chat. This can be a real problem for users - if you use the wrong format, then the model will be confused by your input, and your performance will be a lot worse than it should be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're fine-tuning a model or using it directly for inference, it's always a good idea to minimize these distribution shifts and keep the input you give it as similar as possible to the input it was trained on. With regular language models, it's relatively easy to do that - simply load your tokenizer and model from the same checkpoint, and you're good to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "With chat models, however, it's a bit different. This is because \"chat\" is not just a single string of text that can be straightforwardly tokenized - it's a sequence of messages, each of which contains a role as well as content, which is the actual text of the message. Most commonly, the roles are \"user\" for messages sent by the user, \"assistant\" for responses written by the model, and optionally \"system\" for high-level directives given at the start of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of messages needs to be converted into a text string before it can be tokenized and used as input to a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the problem that chat templates aim to solve. Chat templates are Jinja template strings that are saved and loaded with your tokenizer, and that contain all the information needed to turn a list of chat messages into a correctly formatted input for your model. Here are three chat template strings, corresponding to the three message formats above:\n",
