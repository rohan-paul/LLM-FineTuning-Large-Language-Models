    "\n",
    "- The `input_ids` tensor from tokenized data usually has a shape of `[batch_size, seq_length]`, where `batch_size` is the number of sequences and `seq_length` is the length of each sequence. If you're processing a single sequence, `batch_size` would be 1. f you have 10 sequences of text data that you want to process at the same time, your batch size will be 10.\n",

The `:` indicates that we are selecting all sequences (across the batch dimension), and `i:j` specifies the range of tokens to select from each sequence. This way, you get a continuous slice of tokens from every sequence in the batch. This operation is vital for creating uniform-length sequences for model input.\n",

    "- **Why Not Row-wise**: Row-wise slicing would imply selecting specific sequences (entire sequences) rather than specific tokens within each sequence.

This approach improves the overall accuracy of the quantization process by ensuring the most significant weights are processed with greater precision.
